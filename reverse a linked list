Reverse a linked list. You should use O(1) space.

Pseudocode:  
(Note: Never write pseudocode in an actual interview. Unless you're writing a few lines quickly to plan out your solution.
Your actual solution should be in a real language and use good syntax.) 

 prev = null 
 curr = head 
 while curr != null  
      Node next = curr.next      
      curr.next = prev      
      prev = curr      
      curr = next
      
 prev is the new head, return prev 
 
Test Cases:  Edge Cases: Empty list  Base Cases: Single node, 2 nodes  Regular Cases: > 2 nodes 
Time Complexity: O(n) 
Space Complexity: O(1)  

public static Node reverse(Node head) { 
   Node prev = null, curr = head;     
   while (curr != null) {         
       Node next = curr.getNext();         
       curr.setNext(prev);        
       prev = curr;         
       curr = next;     
       }     
       return prev;
    }
